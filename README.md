# omnimapper_ros

## Installation

Follow the instructions for OmniMapper installation in readme in the [OmniMapper repository](https://github.com/CogRob/omnimapper).

Pay careful attention to the steps for installing CSM (Canonical Scan Matcher).

Once that installation is done, simply clone this repository into your ROS workspace, run `catkin_make`, and things should work.
